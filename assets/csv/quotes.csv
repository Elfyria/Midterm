"All worlds begin in darkness, and all so end. The heart is no different. Darkness sprouts within it, grows, consumes it. Such is its nature. In the end, every heart returns to the darkness whence it came. You see, darkness is the heart's true essence."|5

"Take a look at this tiny place. To the heart seeking freedom, this island is a prison, surrounded by water...and so this boy sought out to escape from his prison. He sought a way to cross over into other worlds, and he opened his heart to darkness."|5

"It's the Heartless. They've been attacking worlds and taking their hearts. And worlds with no hearts vanish into darkness. But if we can lock the door between the two realms—light and dark—from both sides, we can protect the other worlds. So ya see, I came here to find the key on this side.
